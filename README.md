Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the [New York Citi Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike). program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

## Results for NY Citibike Study ##

 This case study aims to explore the riding patterns of Citi Bikers from April to September 2023, shedding light on their preferred routes, rush hours, popular bike types, and the popularity of specific bike stations. Additionally, it seeks to identify the days of the week when riders are most active. The study also intends to propose enhancements to the Citi program, emphasizing a shift towards annual subscriptions instead of casual daily memberships. Biking activity is predominantly observed during the mid-late summer season, with July and August emerging as the most favored months.
